      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past several years, I have built a strong foundation in frontend web development. I have worked on various projects including personal websites, business portfolios, and interactive documents. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and document formatting tools like MS Word and Adobe PDF. I have developed custom CVs tailored to different industries and roles with professional styling and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also design interactive book layouts, brochures, and reports for academic and professional use. In each project, I ensure high standards, accuracy, and visual appeal. Whether it's a job application document or a multi-page digital book, I bring creativity and attention to detail. I’m proficient in modern tools and technologies like HTML5, CSS3 animations, JavaScript functions, and responsive layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have helped clients establish their personal brand by building dynamic portfolio websites and resumes. I apply clean code practices, maintain user accessibility, and enhance readability. My JavaScript work often includes dropdowns, interactive forms, toggles, and user feedback messages that enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to technical skills, I bring excellent communication and teamwork abilities. I’ve managed document-heavy projects under tight deadlines while delivering top quality. My mission is to help people present themselves professionally, whether it’s on a screen or paper. I love mixing code with creativity — especially through animations, transitions, and personalized experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a computer operator, I’m also proficient in handling backups, data entry, file conversions, typing, and printing setups. I help clients streamline their tasks using tools like Microsoft Office Suite, Google Docs, Notepad++, and formatting utilities. I keep learning and adapting to the latest trends in design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I am proud of being a reliable, creative, and detail-oriented professional in both frontend development and computer operations. I always strive to improve, stay current with new tech, and serve others through meaningful digital design.
